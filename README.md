# Background

Motivated by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project emerged from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining other work to find optimal jobs.

Data is sourced from the ðŸ”—[SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql), which provides valuable insights into job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I sought to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for the top-paying Data Analyst jobs?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for Data Analysts?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
ðŸ”§ For this analysis, I used several key tools:

**Postgres SQL**: Selected as the database management system, it's optimal for managing job posting data.
**Visual Studio Code**: My primary tool for database management and SQL query execution.
**Git and GitHub**: Crucial for version control and sharing SQL scripts and analyses, fostering collaboration and project tracking.
**Tableau**: Utilized for data visualization, empowering the creation of insightful visual representations of my analyses.

# The Analysis
Queries in this project aimed to investigate specific facets of the data analysis job market.
Here's my approach to each question:

### 1. Top-paying data analyst jobs
o pinpoint the highest-paying positions, I sifted through data analyst roles based on average salary and location, with a focus on remote opportunities. This query returns the lucrative prospects within the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    name AS company_name,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact 
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim  ON job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short='Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

```
